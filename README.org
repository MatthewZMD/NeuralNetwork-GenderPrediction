#+TITLE: Neural Network: Gender Prediction
* What is it?
  This is a simple Neural Network python demo that predicts gender given weight (lb) and height (in) of the person.
* What does it use?
  - Python 3
  - NumPy
    #+BEGIN_SRC text
    NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

  - Backpropagation algorithm
    #+BEGIN_SRC text
    Backpropagation is the central mechanism by which neural networks learn.
    It is the messenger telling the network whether or not the net made a mistake when it made a prediction.

  - Stochastic Gradient Descent
    #+BEGIN_SRC text
    Stochastic gradient descent is an iterative method for optimizing an objective function with suitable smoothness properties.
